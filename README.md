Description: The Life Expectancy Visualization has multiple small line graphs. Each line graph represents one country and visualizes 
correlation between life expectancy of the country and factors such as GDP, BMI, spending on health care, schooling, number of diseases reported.
The high quality visualization has a dropdown menu through which you can select either of the five factors. By selecting the 
options on Dropdown menu, the visualization changes dynamically. The graphical representation will have life expectancy versus
the factor we select through the Dropdown menu for each country. Each graphical visualization will also have a brief description
to familarize user with the correlation in line graphs.
